# Ft_Containers

A re-implementation of the `vector`, `stack`, `map` and `set` **C++ containers** from the **STL**. The `stack` implementation is based on the `vector` implementation, and the `set` one on `map`.

The underlying structure of `vector` is a **dynamic array**, and for `map`, it's a **red-black tree**. The code was made to be **modular** and **reusable**: for exemple, the **binary tree** used in `map` can be used as a standalone.

## Notes

`.devcontainer`, `.vscode`, `.clang-format` and `compile_flags.txt` where files/directories needed to facilitate development. They where used to: have a common dev environment, launch debugger, and use **lldb** and **clang format**.
